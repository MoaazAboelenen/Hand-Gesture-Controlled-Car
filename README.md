# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Car
ðŸ¤– Hand Gesture Controlled Car using Arduino
This project showcases a simple yet effective hand gesture controlled car built using Arduino and accelerometer-based motion sensing. By detecting the orientation of your hand, the system interprets directional gestures to control a 2WD robotic car in real-time.

ðŸš— Features
Control car movement using hand gestures:

Tilt forward â†’ Move Forward

Tilt backward â†’ Move Backward

Tilt left â†’ Turn Left

Tilt right â†’ Turn Right

Steady hand â†’ Stop

Wireless communication using RF modules 

Built using an Arduino Uno/Nano, accelerometer (e.g., MPU6050 ), motor driver (L298N), and DC motors

ðŸ§° Components Used
Arduino Uno or Nano (2x â€“ one for transmitter, one for receiver)

Accelerometer Sensor (e.g., MPU6050)

L298N Motor Driver Module

2 or 4 DC Gear Motors + Wheels

RF Transmitter/Receiver (433 MHz) or Bluetooth HC-05 (alternative)

2x 9V Batteries or Li-ion Battery Pack

Breadboard and jumper wires

Chassis for the car

ðŸ”Œ How It Works
Gesture Detection: The accelerometer mounted on your hand detects tilt/orientation.

Data Transmission: The sensor data is processed by a transmitter Arduino, which sends control signals wirelessly.

Car Control: The receiver Arduino interprets the signals and drives the motors accordingly through the motor driver.
